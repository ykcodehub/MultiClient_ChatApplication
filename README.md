# 💬 chatApp - Java Multi-Client Chat Application

**chatApp** is a multi-threaded chat application built using Java where multiple clients can connect to a single server and communicate **publicly** (group chat) or **privately** (direct messages). This project demonstrates the use of **Java Sockets** and **Multithreading** to simulate a real-time chat system.
