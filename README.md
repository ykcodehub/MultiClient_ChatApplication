# chatApp - Java Multi-Client Chat Application

**chatApp** is a multi-threaded chat application built using Java where multiple clients can connect to a single server and communicate **publicly** (group chat) or **privately** (direct messages). This project demonstrates the use of **Java Sockets** and **Multithreading** to simulate a real-time chat system.

## Features

-  **Multiple Clients** can connect to a single server
-  **Public Chat**: All messages are broadcast to all connected users
-  **Private Chat**: Users can send direct messages to specific users
-  **Multithreaded Server**: Each client runs on a separate thread
-  Unique usernames for each client
-  Graceful disconnection and server handling

---

##  Technologies Used

- Java `Socket` and `ServerSocket`
- Java `Threads` for concurrent client handling
- Java I/O Streams (`BufferedReader`, `PrintWriter`)
- Command-line interface (CLI)

---

##  concept Demonstrated

- Socket Programming
- Multithreading
- Client-Server Architecture
- Input/Output Stream Handling
- Synchronized
